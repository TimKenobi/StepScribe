# StepScribe

**AI-powered recovery journaling — one step at a time.**

StepScribe is a private, self-hosted journaling companion designed for people in addiction recovery. It pairs a rich journaling experience with a persistent AI companion that learns about you over time — like a sponsor who actually remembers what you told them last week.

Built with Traditional Catholic sensibility by default, but fully adaptable to any faith tradition or secular approach.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| **Frontend** | Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript 5, Tailwind CSS v4 |
| **Backend** | Python 3.12, FastAPI 0.115, SQLAlchemy 2.0 (async) |
| **Database** | SQLite with aiosqlite (async driver) |
| **AI** | Strategy pattern — OpenAI, Anthropic, Grok/xAI, Ollama, Custom |
| **Editor** | TipTap rich text editor |
| **PDF** | WeasyPrint |
| **Container** | Docker Compose |

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and Docker Compose
- Optional: API key for cloud AI (Grok, OpenAI, Anthropic). Local Ollama works without keys.

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/TimKenobi/StepScribe.git
cd StepScribe

# Build and start
docker compose up -d --build

# Open http://localhost:3100
# First visit will launch the onboarding wizard:
#   1. AI Provider & API Key
#   2. Faith Tradition
#   3. About You
#   4. Your Heroes
#   5. Done
```

**Note**: API keys can now be configured directly in the UI during onboarding or in Settings. The `.env` file is only needed for initial defaults or when using custom endpoints.

### Default Ports
| Service | Port |
|---------|------|
| Frontend | `3100` |
| Backend API | `8100` |

Change in `.env` via `FRONTEND_PORT` and `BACKEND_PORT`.

### Using Ollama (Free, Local AI)

```bash
# Install Ollama: https://ollama.ai
ollama pull llama3
ollama serve

# In .env:
AI_PROVIDER=ollama
OLLAMA_MODEL=llama3
```

## How AI Memory Works

1. **You journal or chat** — write entries, talk to the AI Sponsor
2. **AI extracts insights** — after every conversation exchange and journal publish, the AI analyzes the text and extracts categorized memories (struggles, patterns, triggers, milestones, etc.)
3. **Memories are stored** — each insight is saved to the `ai_memories` table with category, source, and active/inactive status
4. **Context is built** — on every AI interaction, `get_memory_context()` gathers: your about_me, faith tradition, hero names, all active memories (grouped by category), and recent mood trend
5. **AI knows you** — this full context is injected into the system prompt, so the AI speaks with genuine understanding of your situation

You can view, toggle, and delete memories at any time on the AI Memory page.

## Data Persistence

All data lives in the `data/` directory (mapped via Docker volumes):
- `data/db/stepscribe.db` — SQLite database
- `data/exports/` — Generated PDF exports
- `data/uploads/` — Uploaded photos and files

To back up: copy the `data/` folder. To reset: delete `data/db/stepscribe.db` and restart.

---

## Configuration

See [.env.example](.env.example) for all available settings. Key options:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `AI_PROVIDER` | `openai` | AI backend: openai, anthropic, grok, ollama, custom |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | — | Your OpenAI API key |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | — | Your Anthropic API key |
| `GROK_API_KEY` | — | Your xAI/Grok API key |
| `OLLAMA_MODEL` | `llama3` | Which Ollama model to use |
| `BACKEND_PORT` | `8100` | Backend API port |
| `FRONTEND_PORT` | `3100` | Frontend port |

## Roadmap

- [ ] **Multi-user support** — Individual user accounts with authentication for the web server version. Currently single-user (all data under "default" user).
- [ ] **Group/sponsor sharing** — Share journal entries or progress with a sponsor or accountability group
- [ ] **Mobile-responsive PWA** — Installable progressive web app for phone use
- [ ] **Backup/restore** — One-click database backup and restore from the UI
